How the Empowering the Nation App Works
 
The Empowering the Nation app is designed to help users explore and enrol in skills training courses for domestic workers and gardeners.
Home Screen: Introduces users to the organization’s mission and provides easy navigation to explore courses, view discounts, and contact support.
Courses Section: Lists all available courses with descriptions, durations, and fees. Users can view detailed information on each course and select multiple courses to receive a discount.
Discounts: The app applies discounts automatically based on the number of courses selected:
Enrolment: Users can create an account, select courses, and complete enrolment. They’ll receive a schedule and reminders for upcoming classes.
Contact and Support: A contact page allows users to request more information or reach customer support for assistance.
The app provides a convenient way for users to access training that enhances their skills and career opportunities.
